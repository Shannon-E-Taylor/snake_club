# Making fancy graphs for prokaryotes/genome statistics

Tasks/things to do:
1. Generalise/reproduce the graph
	1. Stratify based on country
	1. "Rank" the universities based on genome quality
	1. See least sequenced genus
	1. Does the popularity of prokaryote correlate with their genome quality
	1. Most popular prokaryote of the year

================================================================================

Some data exploration ideas:
1. Look at distribution of each column
1. Manipulating data with pandas

End goals:
1. Interactive graph(s) based on the test data
1. Blog post?
1. Jupyter notebook
