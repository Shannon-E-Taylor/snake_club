# Projects

Summary of 15th September meeting to discuss project ideas
----------------------------------------------------------

We would like to make something that would allow us to demonstrate that:
- We can write some Python code,
- manage software-based projects,
- use git and version control appropriately

Additionally, we decided that we would like to make something that would be:

- useful (preferably to the scientific community)
- interesting

Several project ideas were discussed and ranked based on difficulty, time commitment and how interested we were in the idea.

The top project idea that was decided upon was 'a spell-checker/data sanitiser for bioinformatics datasets'.

For next Friday (21st)
----------------------

We need to do some planning and think about a few key points:
- Does this tool exist already?
- What will our scope be? (Types of data, types of errors or characters)

We should also get everyone that would like to contribute familiar with git and version control.
