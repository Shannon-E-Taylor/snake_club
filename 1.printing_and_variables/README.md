Make sure you have python 3 and installed before starting. (Should be preinstalled on ubuntu)
Return python 3 version in terminal:
	python3 --version

Python 2 is now deprecated, and has some code-breaking differences. Noteably, division in Python 2 only produces integers. 

You can run your scripts/commands via command line if you're comfortable with that, or you can use an IDE (integrated development environment). 
Python comes bundled with an IDE called IDLE

Linux install:
sudo apt-get install idle3
